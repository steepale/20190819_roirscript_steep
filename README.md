This is a Git repo for a very specific tool written in R with supporting dependencies to parse data from a GTF file into a specific format. It is used in a Common Workflow Language (CWL) workflow to determine significnalty mutated regions of the somatic cancer genome of Marek's disease lymphomas to analyze data via R. Unless you are using MuSiC2, this script is probably not useful; instead I recommend using "tidyverse-like" images with R inside: steepalesteepale/20190817_rbaseubuntu:1.1 or better yet from more experienced developers--rocker/tidyverse
